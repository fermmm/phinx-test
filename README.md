# Test for Phinx: Fernando Medina

## Please read this first:
I ran out of time (I'm currently working for a company) so I finished the test without the following points:

1. Unit tests for all the components (If you want me to send some Jest + Enzyme demostrations let me know)
2. Bookmarking (If you want me to send some Local Storage code demostration let me know)
2. Search using a comic link (If you want me to send some string parsing demostrations let me know)
3. Comic list ordered by date
4. More than one comic and character when searching in the url query.

To compensate, the test is done with strong TypeScript usage and many good practices. I hope you like it.
Please provide a feedback since this test is very time consuming.
